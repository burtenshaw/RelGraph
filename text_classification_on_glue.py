so the metric object only computes the one(s) needed for your task.

## Preprocessing the data

Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them. This is done by a ðŸ¤— Transformers `Tokenizer` which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model requires.

To do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` method, which will ensure:

- we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,
- we download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.

That vocabulary will be cached, so it's not downloaded again the next time we run the cell.
"""

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
    
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, use_fast=True)

"""We pass along `use_fast=True` to the call above to use one of the fast tokenizers (backed by Rust) from the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library. Those fast tokenizers are available for almost all models, but if you got an error with the previous call, remove that argument.

You can directly call this tokenizer on one sentence or a pair of sentences:
"""

tokenizer("Hello, this one sentence!", "And this sentence goes with it.")

"""Depending on the model you selected, you will see different keys in the dictionary returned by the cell above. They don't matter much for what we're doing here (just know they are required by the model we will instantiate later), you can learn more about them in [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/transformers/preprocessing.html) if you're interested.

To preprocess our dataset, we will thus need the names of the columns containing the sentence(s). The following dictionary keeps track of the correspondence task to column names:
"""

task_to_keys = {
    "cola": ("sentence", None),
    "mnli": ("premise", "hypothesis"),
    "mnli-mm": ("premise", "hypothesis"),
    "mrpc": ("sentence1", "sentence2"),
    "qnli": ("question", "sentence"),
    "qqp": ("question1", "question2"),

        return tokenizer(examples[sentence1_key], truncation=True)
    return tokenizer(examples[sentence1_key], examples[sentence2_key], truncation=True)

"""This function works with one or several examples. In the case of several examples, the tokenizer will return a list of lists for each key:"""

preprocess_function(dataset['train'][:5])

"""To apply this function on all the sentences (or pairs of sentences) in our dataset, we just use the `map` method of our `dataset` object we created earlier. This will apply the function on all the elements of all the splits in `dataset`, so our training, validation and testing data will be preprocessed in one single command."""

encoded_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)

"""Even better, the results are automatically cached by the ðŸ¤— Datasets library to avoid spending time on this step the next time you run your notebook. The ðŸ¤— Datasets library is normally smart enough to detect when the function you pass to map has changed (and thus requires to not use the cache data). For instance, it will properly detect if you change the task in the first cell and rerun the notebook. ðŸ¤— Datasets warns you when it uses cached files, you can pass `load_from_cache_file=False` in the call to `map` to not use the cached files and force the preprocessing to be applied again.

Note that we passed `batched=True` to encode the texts by batches together. This is to leverage the full benefit of the fast tokenizer we loaded earlier, which will use multi-threading to treat the texts in a batch concurrently.

## Fine-tuning the model

Now that our data is ready, we can download the pretrained model and fine-tune it. Since all our tasks are about sentence classification, we use the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class. Like with the tokenizer, the `from_pretrained` method will download and cache the model for us. The only thing we have to specify is the number of labels for our problem (which is always 2, except for STS-B which is a regression problem and MNLI where we have 3 labels):
"""

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer

num_labels = 3 if task.startswith("mnli") else 1 if task=="stsb" else 2
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, num_labels=num_labels)

"""The warning is telling us we are throwing away some weights (the `vocab_transform` and `vocab_layer_norm` layers) and randomly initializing some other (the `pre_classifier` and `classifier` layers). This is absolutely normal in this case, because we are removing the head used to pretrain the model on a masked language modeling objective and replacing it with a new head for which we don't have pretrained weights, so the library warns us we should fine-tune this model before using it for inference, which is exactly what we are going to do.

To instantiate a `Trainer`, we will need to define two more things. The most important is the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments), which is a class that contains all the attributes to customize the training. It requires one folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model, and all other arguments are optional:
"""

metric_name = "pearson" if task == "stsb" else "matthews_correlation" if task == "cola" else "accuracy"
#%%
args = TrainingArguments(
    "test-glue",

    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model=metric_name,
)

"""Here we set the evaluation to be done at the end of each epoch, tweak the learning rate, use the `batch_size` defined at the top of the notebook and customize the number of epochs for training, as well as the weight decay. Since the best model might not be the one at the end of training, we ask the `Trainer` to load the best model it saved (according to `metric_name`) at the end of training.

The last thing to define for our `Trainer` is how to compute the metrics from the predictions. We need to define a function for this, which will just use the `metric` we loaded earlier, the only preprocessing we have to do is to take the argmax of our predicted logits (our just squeeze the last axis in the case of STS-B):
"""

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    predictions, labels = eval_pred
    if task != "stsb":
        predictions = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
    else:
        predictions = predictions[:, 0]
    return metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)

"""Then we just need to pass all of this along with our datasets to the `Trainer`:"""

validation_key = "validation_mismatched" if task == "mnli-mm" else "validation_matched" if task == "mnli" else "validation"
trainer = Trainer(
    model,
    args,
    train_dataset=encoded_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=encoded_dataset[validation_key],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics
)

"""You might wonder why we pass along the `tokenizer` when we already preprocessed our data. This is because we will use it once last time to make all the samples we gather the same length by applying padding, which requires knowing the model's preferences regarding padding (to the left or right? with which token?). The `tokenizer` has a pad method that will do all of this right for us, and the `Trainer` will use it. You can customize this part by defining and passing your own `data_collator` which will receive the samples like the dictionaries seen above and will need to return a dictionary of tensors.

We can now finetune our model by just calling the `train` method:
"""

trainer.train()

"""We can check with the `evaluate` method that our `Trainer` did reload the best model properly (if it was not the last one):"""
#%%
trainer.evaluate()

"""To see how your model fared you can compare it to the [GLUE Benchmark leaderboard](https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).

"""

# ! pip install optuna
# ! pip install ray[tune]
